## Description
Have you ever wanted to play your favorite game but couldn’t find the right person to play with? Struggling through random game lobbies with random people can feel like such a hassle when you just want to have a good time with the right people. This is where our project known as G-inder (Gamer Tinder) will help. G-inder is an online gamer database where different players from different games can put up posts looking for other people to play with. In each of these posts players will discuss what kind of players they’re looking for whether it be purely to have fun with others, or it be skilled based if someone is looking for a person of similar ranks in their game.

Once someone finds a post in our database that matches what they're looking for they can click on the user's post and comment to let the poster know that they're available. From here the poster can click on the commenters profile and decide if he wants to join up with this player and add him on their preferred gaming device. Profiles can include details such as preferred gaming device, preferred games, and skill level within the game.

## Technologies/Languages/Frameworks:

G-inder will utilize  HTML, CSS to structure the content and appearance. Currently we plan to use vanilla javascript for user interactions with the application, however in the future we may plan to use a Framework such as React. We will implement a DataBase that will store user profile information such as the gamer’s usernames, console device, experience level, and the games that the user plays. The database management system is still yet to be decided for our application.
