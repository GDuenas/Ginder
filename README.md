## Application Name:
G-Inder



## Technologies/Languages/Frameworks:

G-inder will utilize  HTML, CSS to structure the content and appearance. Currently we plan to use vanilla javascript for user interactions with the application, however in the future we may plan to use a Framework such as React. We will implement a DataBase that will store user profile information such as the gamerâ€™s usernames, console device, experience level, and the games that the user plays. The database management system is still yet to be decided for our application.
